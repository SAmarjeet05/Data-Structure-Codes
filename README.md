# Data Structure Codes 📚

Welcome to the **Data Structure Codes** repository! This repository contains all the lab programs and exercises related to Data Structures, which I have worked on during my course. These programs demonstrate various fundamental data structures and algorithms using different approaches.

## 📚 About

This repository includes:
- **Lab assignments** covering the implementation and manipulation of key data structures like:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Tree Traversal (PreOrderTraversal, InOrderTraversal and PostOrderTraversal)
  - Graph Traversal (DFS and BFS)
  - Sorting and Searching Algorithms
  - Searching Techniques

## 📜 Concepts Covered

   - Basic Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
   - Advanced Data Structures: Trees, Graphs
   - Algorithms: Sorting (BubbleSort, InsertionSort, etc.), Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search), Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversals (BFS, DFS)
   - Recursion and Iterative Solutions
   - Time and Space Complexity Analysis for algorithms
